Sumaita and I have divided section 3 project planning four topics. I am responsible for handling Human Resource management and
developing the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), as detailed in this page link. Sumaita is taking care of the remaining topics,
specifically creating the PERT chart (based on WBS) and the Gantt Chart.
